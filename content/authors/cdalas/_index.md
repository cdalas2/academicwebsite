caption: Carlos D. Alas is a theoretical and computational physicist working in data science, with a Ph.D. in Physics and M.S. in Computer Science. He earned his doctorate from the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics), where his work under Dr. C. A. Haselwandter uncovered the physical principles governing membrane mechanics, membrane domain formation, and cellular signal transduction. His earlier studies took him through [California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo](https://physics.calpoly.edu) and [Antelope Valley College](https://www.avc.edu). Dr. Alas specializes in statistical mechanics, applying stochastic models across scales — from protein dynamics at the nanoscale to driving behavior at the vehicle scale to trends in financial markets. His work draws on time-series analysis, hidden Markov models, deep learning, and tree-based methods, with a particular focus on anomaly and regime change detection. At The Travelers Indemnity Company, he translates complex R&D concepts into scalable, business-driven solutions — including novel telematics metrics that outperformed industry benchmarks and legacy standards, enabling fairer pricing and better risk segmentation. His approach emphasizes understanding why data trends emerge rather than simply identifying them, favoring simple, interpretable models and adding complexity only when it delivers measurable value. By combining physics-based modeling with machine learning, he creates impactful tools that connect deep research with real-world application. Throughout his academic career, Dr. Alas earned numerous honors, among them a USC Dornsife Fellowship, multiple research scholarships, and a physics subject area award. When he's not modeling the world's hidden patterns, Dr. Alas can be found exploring the diverse landscapes of greater Los Angeles — from the vibrant [coastal regions](https://www.visitlagunabeach.com) to the tranquility of the [Angeles National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/angeles). He enjoys culinary exploration, the occasional low-stakes game of billiards, and stays active through swimming.
